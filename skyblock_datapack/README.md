A very barebones skyblock starting world to test developing the mod. Should have everything to progress.

Required mods to install:

 - This mod, obviously. Run the build target (e.g. using java 17, run ./gradlew build, copy build/libs/arconia-\*.jar to the mods/ folder of the minecraft instance
 - jei
 - patchouli
 - the one probe (not technically, but just do it)

Recommended mods to install:

 - Fast Leaf Decay - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fast-leaf-decay/files
 - Twerk mod for speeding up tree growth - e.g. TwerkItMeal

Installing this pack:

 - Install as a forge-1.18.\* minecraft instance with the mods listed above
 - Launch minecraft. Once it's at the main game menu, quit it
 - Modify config/arconia-common.toml and set isSkyblock to true, then relaunch
 - Create a new world, but don't submit the create world menu just yet
 - Click 'datapacks' in the create world menu
 - Click 'open pack folder'
 - Drag the 'arconia' folder within this folder into the folder that just opened
 - Close the folder browser and go back to the minecraft window. Should now list the Arconia datapack.
 - Click the '>' on it to move it to the right
