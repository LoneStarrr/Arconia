         "Dear diary. I have discovered all that I can, and I really need to be able to find my way back to the nearest village. Tomorrow, I will start my travels to the nearest village to replenish, I have definitely felt better. My supplies have run out, and I must be careful making my escape to not get caught.",
         " I'm confident my notes are detailed enough so that I can reclaim all of the stuff the Leprechauns have stolen. I can't trust any of the villagers with anything though, so I will hide my notes under this tree here where they will be safe from prying eyes."
