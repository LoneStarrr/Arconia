	    "Using the pedestal ritual, the leprechauns were able to infuse some of the magic arconium qualities with gold, forming a solid block. They would place this under one of their hats, and linked it to a pot of gold. To my surprise, this seemed to produce a steady supply of gold coins, all of which were absorbed by the pot.",
        "They enchanted more roots with various items on the pedestals, and linked those to nearby placed hats on chests. Thus, they used the gold coin supply to pull other treasure from the pot. The treasure did not appear very rich in nature to me, but as I later learned, they were able to pull out much more valuable items by using rituals involving different colored arconium ingots."
