The root makes the pot dispense a specific desired item. Doing so will visualize that item over the pot, a nifty trick if you ask me."

If there are multiple items being extracted, you can remove a specific item by putting it in your offhand along with the non-imbued root in your main hand. In either case, you will get an imbued root back for that item."
