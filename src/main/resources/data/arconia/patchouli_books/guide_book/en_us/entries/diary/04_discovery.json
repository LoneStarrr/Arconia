         "Dear diary. The noises came back last night, and this time I was able to discover a bit more. Remember those stories from over-imaginative travellers at taverns around the world? About the little green Leprechauns hoarding their riches, only to have their stashes disclosed by giant multicolored arches in the sky?",
         "Yeah, they might have been on to something, because what I just witnessed struck an uncanny resemblance to those tales. I am safe for now, but I have to be careful not to make any noises."
