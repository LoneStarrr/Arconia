However, only red trees naturally grow in the wild. Upon observing the leprechauns, I have learned that they were able to shift the color of a tree using a specially crafted item."

If placed directly under the trunk of an arconium tree of the same color, it will start to glow. Over time, some of its leaves will change in color. Harvesting those leaves may reward a lucky individual with a tree sapling of that color."
