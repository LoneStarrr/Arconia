If placed under a leprechaun hat that is linked to a pot of gold, the pot will slowly drain its gold contents, which it uses to automatically top itself up."

Once the arconium gold block is drained, it will transform into a block of pure arconium which can then be mined. In pure form, it is used in altar rituals to enchant roots that will make the pot produce various items."
