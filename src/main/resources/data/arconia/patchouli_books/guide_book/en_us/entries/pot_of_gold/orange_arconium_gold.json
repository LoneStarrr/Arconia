	    "Crafting a block of gold using resources from the orange trees appears to give the pot of gold a necessary boost. Not only does the rate of gold coin production increase, but it also unlocks the ability to enchant orange roots using the pedestals. Those seem to bind to more valuable treasure that can be pulled from the pot.",
        "This process of obtaining newly colored trees, ingots and gold blocks seems to repeat itself for different colors as well. One can only imagine the riches that can be extracted from the pot this way. Well, you don't have to really, it is easy to look up in other ways."
