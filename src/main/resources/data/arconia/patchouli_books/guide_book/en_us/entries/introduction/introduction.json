Rather than making an honest living and trade with villagers to get the things they needed, they instead chose to go around and rob anyone they could get their dirty little hands on. It is for good reason their kind have been hunted down to near extinction."

This is where I discovered the truth about these magical pots of gold that you're supposed to find at the end of a rainbow. I was always under the impression that if you somehow were able to find one, you could just take all the gold and be set for life. But that's not at all how it appeared to work."

Whenever they did this, moments later some other item would get flung out of the pot, and they'd catch it in their green little hats. It seemed rather strange to me. The items appeared to be of lesser value than the gold, why not just go to a nearby village and trade it there? But, the leprechauns seemed to be quite content with the trade."
