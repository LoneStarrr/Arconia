The enchanted tree roots are then used to select the item to be extracted from the pot. Simply take one and right-click the linked hat with it. You should now see the item visualized above the hat."

The simplest, yet expensive way, is to right-click the pot of gold with a coin, which you can make using the pedestal ritual. You can inspect how much gold the pot contains by right-clicking it with an empty hand. If multiple hats are linked, the pot will select one at random."
